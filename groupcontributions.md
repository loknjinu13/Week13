We will host a minecraft server on a selected HP machine and Raspberry Pi 3 in order to test two environments. 
The HP machine will run on the Ubuntu ditro(to be specified by Adam) while Raspbian will run on the Raspberry Pi 3.

We will configure an afraid.org dns to ensure our stable versions go online. While we will in due course obtain a subdomain from Saintpaul college through our lecturer Matthew.

We will use as communication platform [discord](https://discordapp.com). 

While all support and research updtates will be sent to the project created on [github](https://github.com/grenack/Code-Blockers).

Add-man had the following contributions;
1. auto correct on the phone will my hp is not linking the wifi usb device but i have a back up plan and its a great idea i have an older dell laptop running debian on it so i can bring the server to class XD it well be up in running every one give me your minecraft usernames so i can white list them once up and running
this wifi usb is the problem i am going to run the server through a vm on desktop just so its setup threw linux.

FOngoh researched using the following in his raspberry installations
a. [Using Spigot](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-minecraft-server/)
With this installation i could not connect my server outside of the local network.
Meanwhile i received an expired server once i connected locally.
